# Library Management System API

A robust and scalable RESTful API built with Node.js, Express, and Sequelize for managing a library system. This API allows you to manage books, authors, and the borrowing/returning of books, all while following best practices in API design and code organization.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a full-featured library management system backend that includes:

- **Book Management:**  
  - Add, update, and delete books (deletion is allowed only if the book is not currently borrowed).  
  - List books with pagination support.  
  - Automatically seed your database with sample book data from a CSV file.

- **Borrowing & Returning Books:**  
  - Borrow books with checks for availability, user tracking, and automatic due dates (default 14 days).  
  - Return books and track overdue returns with calculated late days.

- **Reports & Search:**  
  - Generate reports of overdue books including user details and days overdue.  
  - Bonus: Search functionality to filter books by title, author, or ISBN.

## Technical Highlights

- **Backend Framework:**  
  Built with [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) for a lightweight and flexible server setup.

- **Database Management:**  
  Uses [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) as the ORM to manage database interactions with PostgreSQL, including migrations and seeders for automated setup.

- **RESTful Design:**  
  Follows RESTful standards with clear endpoints, HTTP methods, and response codes.

- **Validation & Error Handling:**  
  Implements basic data validation and robust error handling to ensure a reliable API.

- **Testing:**  
  Automated tests using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) to ensure quality and maintainability.

- **Deployment & Automation:**  
  Includes npm scripts for installing dependencies, running migrations, seeding the database, starting the server, and running testsâ€”all with a single command.
